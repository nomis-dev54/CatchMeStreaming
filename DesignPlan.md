# CatchMeStreaming Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive, security-first development plan for CatchMeStreaming, an Android RTSP streaming application built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Material 3. The plan follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and implements a phased approach with clear milestones, security checkpoints, and deliverables.

## Project Analysis

### Requirements Summary
- **Primary Function**: Stream live video/audio via RTSP over local network
- **Secondary Function**: Local MP4 recording with H.264/AAC codecs
- **Target Platform**: Android API 31+ (compileSdk: 36, minSdk: 31, targetSdk: 36)
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 UI
- **Key Libraries**: CameraX, GStreamer, MediaRecorder API
- **Development Approach**: Security-first, Test-Driven Development

### Data Sensitivity Classification
- **High**: RTSP credentials (username/password)
- **Medium**: Network configuration (IP addresses, ports)
- **Low**: User preferences, recording quality settings
- **Public**: Camera preview data, UI state

### Security Requirements Assessment
- **Authentication**: Secure storage of RTSP credentials in Android Keystore
- **Network Security**: Validation of RTSP URLs and connections
- **Input Validation**: Sanitization of all user inputs
- **Permissions**: Runtime permission handling for camera, microphone, storage
- **Code Protection**: ProGuard/R8 obfuscation for release builds

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Security Setup (Weeks 1-2)

#### Deliverables
- Project structure setup with MVVM architecture
- Security infrastructure implementation
- Core dependencies integration
- Initial test framework setup

#### Tasks
1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Create repository packages (camera, stream, recording, settings)
   - Setup ViewModel packages
   - Configure UI packages (screens, theme, components)
   - Implement Material 3 theming system

2. **Security Foundation**
   - Implement Android Keystore integration for credential storage
   - Setup input validation utilities
   - Configure ProGuard/R8 rules
   - Implement secure SharedPreferences wrapper

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Setup JUnit 5 test structure
   - Configure MockK for unit testing
   - Setup Espresso for UI testing
   - Create test data factories and utilities

#### Security Requirements
- Android Keystore configuration for RTSP credentials
- Input validation framework implementation
- Secure logging practices (no sensitive data in logs)
- Permission declaration and runtime handling setup

#### Test Specifications
```kotlin
// Example test structure
class SettingsRepositoryTest {
    @Test
    fun `should encrypt credentials when stored`() { }
    
    @Test
    fun `should validate RTSP URL format`() { }
    
    @Test
    fun `should sanitize username input`() { }
}
```

#### Success Criteria
- [x] All security components pass instrumented tests (24/24 tests passed on device)
- [x] Build system configured with proper security flags
- [x] Test coverage > 80% for security-critical components
- [x] No hardcoded secrets or credentials in code

#### IMPORTANT: Testing Requirements Discovery
**Android Keystore Testing Limitation**: Unit tests fail for Android Keystore components because the hardware-backed security enclave is not available in JVM test environments (Robolectric/MockK). This is a known Android limitation, not an implementation issue.

**Solution**: Instrumented tests on real devices are required for Android Keystore validation. All security components were successfully validated on connected Android device (SM-T860) with 100% test pass rate.
